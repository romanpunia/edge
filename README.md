## About ðŸ‘»
Mavi is a cross-platform C++14/17/20 framework to create any type of application from a unified interface. In it's core, Mavi is based on same concepts as Node.js but made to it's extreme. As in Node, Mavi has a worker pool that not only consumes but also publishes tasks, here we don't really have a concept of event loop, every thread is on it's own an event loop.

Using concept of tasks and queues, in Mavi there are two rules for optimal performace and proper CPU loading:
1. Split work in to small pieces.
2. Use scheduler to process those small pieces.

There are two types of thread workers in a thread pool: light and heavy. Light threads processes non-blocking tasks such as event dispatching, non-blocking IO and coroutines. Heavy threads are in charge of everything else such as CPU bound tasks and blocking IO. Mavi is made to be as scalable as possible without even thinking about scalability which in turn makes development of multithreaded systems quite a lot easier.

Originally, Mavi was only a game engine but now it isn't. All the features for game development are there but it can be easily stripped out to reduce size of executable and use only needed functionality. There are cases when Mavi is used as a framework for building a high performance backend server or a daemon, most of the time all we need in that case is OpenSSL and maybe Zlib with PostgreSQL or MongoDB, so we strip out everything else that way reducing compile time, executable size and runtime memory usage to minimum. Turns out, Mavi can easily run in a very limited machines that were slow even in 2006.

If your goal is to make a game, Mavi is not really a consumer ready product to build AAA games as it is very low level. I tried to make it so that if you need some functionality such as a new entity component, advanced rendering techinque such as Ray-Tracing, a new rendering backend or even a motion capture system to create cutscenes, you can make it in a relatively short time without hurting performance. Why isn't it already contained in this engine? I'm the only developer, physically impossible.

For games, Mavi is a 3D optimized engine, there is a posibility to render efficient 2D graphics with batching but that is not a priority. Main shading language is HLSL, it is transpiled or directly compiled and saved to cache when needed. Rendering is based on stacking, that way you specify renderers for a camera (order matters), when rendering is initiated we process each renderer step by step, renderer can initiate sub-pass to render another part of scene for shadows, reflections, transparency and others. Before rendering begins, render lists are prepared for geometry rendering based on culling results, for sub-passes we use frustum and indexed culling, for main passes we also use occlusion culling. Culling, physics, audio and rendering are done multhreaded if possible. In best case, we don't have any synchronization between threads but when we need to write to shared data,
for example, destroy a rigid body owned by physics engine, we use scene transactions that are just callbacks that are guaranteed to be executed thread safe (in scope of scene) which in turn makes scene eventual consistent as transactions are fired later when all parallel tasks are finished.

Another important aspect of Mavi is schemas, they are used to serialize and deserialize data. For game, their main purpose is to provide containers for serialized game states such as meshes, animations, materials, scenes, configurations and other. For services, they can be used as a data transmitting containers to convert between XML, JSON, JSONB, MongoDB documents, PostgreSQL results and others.

## Building (standalone)
Mavi uses CMake as building system. Microsoft [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) is suggested.
1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/).
2. Install desired dynamic dependencies listed below to have all the functionality (if you are not using vcpkg).
3. Execute CMake command to generate the files or use CMake GUI if you have one.
If you want to use vcpkg then add VCPKG_ROOT environment variable and execute CMake generate, it will install dependencies automatically using JSON manifest file. Another option is to set CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE option (standard workflow for vcpkg), dependency installation will also be automatic. For example,
> cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ...

## Building (subproject)
1. *Optional* If you use vcpkg then add toolchain file (vcpkg doesn't know how to install dependencies of subproject, you will have to specify needed dependencies in vcpkg.json near your CMakeLists.txt):
```cmake
include(path/to/mavi/lib/toolchain.cmake)
#...
project(app_name)
```
2. *Optional* If you don't specify any compile flags then you may use Mavi's compiler flags:
```cmake
include(path/to/mavi/lib/compiler.cmake)
```
3. Add subproject. This will fully link your application with Mavi.
```cmake
add_subdirectory(/path/to/mavi mavi)
link_directories(/path/to/mavi)
target_include_directories(app_name PRIVATE /path/to/mavi)
target_link_libraries(app_name PRIVATE mavi)
```
4. Execute CMake command to generate the files or use CMake GUI if you have one.
You can look at [Lynx's CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/romanpunia/lynx/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) to find out how it should be used in practice
